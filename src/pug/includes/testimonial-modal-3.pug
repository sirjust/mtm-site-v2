                            p I would definitely recommend Rachel's lessons to anyone who would like to learn how to sing or keep cultivating and improving their talent. Such an amazing teacher and a wonderful human being! Her lessons aren't only fruitful and dynamic, she makes them really fun and enjoyable too. I love how she doesn't just stick to your mistakes or the things you must correct while working on a song, but how she points out the good things you are bringing to the song as well. She gives very good advice and clear examples that help you to improve your technique... With her classes I've not only noticed a great improvement in my voice, but a boost in my confidence and self esteem
