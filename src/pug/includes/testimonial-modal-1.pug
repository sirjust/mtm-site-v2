                            p Rachel is a phenomenal teacher. I have been searching my whole life for a teacher who fully understands musical theatre, opera and all of their many stylings. Not only is she an amazing performer with years of experience on the stage, she is kind-hearted and has a passion for teaching. I could not ask for a better teacher!
